# CodeIgniter Query Builder Abstraction
An Easy to Clone and Use CodeIgniter Database Query Builder Class Abstraction

All you need to do is to clone is repository, edit and require db_connect.php in your project. You can get started by looking into db_sample.php and visiting https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/query_builder.html for more info.

> Please note that database library is built by CodeIgniter Team and Volunteers, I made this repo for others to use it as abstraction independently in their projects.
